# Piano + Metronome MQTT LED Control System

*An individual IoT project for CASA0014: Connected Environments at UCL*

------

## Overview

This project combines **music interaction** with **IoT communication**, allowing users to play piano keys and visualize sound and rhythm through a **72-LED luminaire** connected via **MQTT**. Users can switch between practice mode and performance mode to help themselves improve their piano skills.

It was developed as part of the **CASA0014: Connected Environments** module at **University College London (UCL)**, which focuses on understanding and building connected IoT systems for people and the environment.

The system uses an **Arduino MKR WiFi 1010**, **Grove LCD display**, **8 mechanical piano keys**, a **slider potentiometer**, and a **state machine switch** to switch between *Performance* and *Metronome* modes.

## üéì Background & Motivation

The idea behind this project was to explore how **physical interaction (music performance)** could be connected to **digital visualization and feedback** through IoT.
 By mapping piano key inputs to LED color patterns and synchronizing rhythm through MQTT, the project demonstrates an **end-to-end IoT pipeline** ‚Äî from local sensing and actuation to network communication and visualization.

This aligns with CASA0014‚Äôs aims to teach prototyping, communication, and environmental connectivity through practical design.

- **State Machine Logic:**

  ```
  int modeSwitch = digitalRead(10);
  if (modeSwitch == LOW) {
    currentMode = PERFORMANCE_MODE;
  } else {
    currentMode = METRONOME_MODE;
  }
  ```

- **BPM Mapping:**

  ```
  bpm = map(analogRead(A0), 0, 1023, 40, 200);
  ```
