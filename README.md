# CASA0014: CONNECTED ENVIRONMENTS

### by Zihang He

## Overview

This repository is a **fork** of the original [ucl-casa-ce/casa0014](https://github.com/ucl-casa-ce/casa0014) repository for the UCL module **CASA0014 – Connected Environments**.

For the introduction of my personal piano-making project, please refer to here: [Zihang_He_Piano](https://github.com/xms12138/casa0014_Zihang_He/tree/main/Zihang_He_Piano)



## Purpose of This Fork

I forked the original repository to host my personal coursework for **CASA0014** and to extend the practical IoT components beyond the base examples. All of my contents are on "[Zihang_He_Piano]" this folder.
 Specifically, this fork includes my individual project:

> **Piano + Metronome MQTT LED Control System**
>  A custom IoT prototype combining musical input, metronome control, and MQTT-based LED visualization.



## Key Additions & Modifications

- Added a new folder **`Zihang_He_Piano/`** containing:
  - Arduino sketches for piano-key and metronome integration.
  - Hardware documentation (`/hardware_components/`) describing sensors, wiring, and device behavior.
- Updated hardware configuration to include:
  - 8 mechanical piano switches.
  - Grove LCD RGB Backlight display for real-time note and BPM readout.
  - Slider potentiometer for BPM adjustment.
  - State-machine switch for toggling between *Performance* and *Metronome* modes.
  - Passive buzzer for rhythmic feedback.



## What is in the CASA0014 GitHub repository?

This repo is being used to share materials used in the workshop component of the module. Some overview information is below but the key items are:

- links to [Vespera project folder](vespera)

- workshop - [Web LED](/webled/)

...

But for posterity we have also kept the old workshops for extra curricula activity!

- pre 2024 workshop - [blinking monster](/2023blinkingMonster/)

- pre 2024 workshop - [plant monitor](/2023plantMonitor/)

- 2024 workshop - [Chrono Lumina](/2024chronoLumina/)

## Module Aims and Objectives

After having taking this module, you will develop skills in three key areas and should be able to:

Domain Knowledge
- Understand the building blocks of of creating a connected environment (Internet of Things, IoT)
- Understand the various actors participating in our digitally connected environment
- Understand the context of IoT through work that has gone before and Living Lab environments

Prototyping Skills
- Create a simple Arduino sketch with a sensor input and / or actuator output
- Connect an Arduino based IoT device to a datastore to collect data over a wireless network
- Sketch, photograph and use rapid prototyping to explore ideas

Collaboration
- Provide peer feedback to fellow students on project work (a “learn, build, critique” approach will be used throughout the course)
- Create and present design decisions and prototypes to receive critical feedback
- Document and share project information to support reproducible research

In addition, you will establish a shared ‘connected environment’ that you will curate throughout the programme.


## Software

The course will make heavy use of the following software packages

- **Arduino** Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) Click the `JUST DOWNLOAD` link to the left of the `CONTRIBUTE & DOWNLOAD` button. Once downloaded follow the instructions to install.
  
- **GitHub** Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) if you don't already have one.

- **Git client.** If you are comfortable using Git on the command line then go for it. If you prefer a GUI representation then download a git client to make your life easier. 
    - We use [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/) which has a [free version for students](https://www.git-tower.com/students/mac). 
    - We also hear good things about [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) 
    - and there are a few other open source [GUI Clients here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows)
