# CASA0014: CONNECTED ENVIRONMENTS

### by Zihang He

## Overview

This repository is a **fork** of the original [ucl-casa-ce/casa0014](https://github.com/ucl-casa-ce/casa0014) repository for the UCL module **CASA0014 – Connected Environments**.

For the introduction of my personal piano-making project, please refer to here: [Zihang_He_Piano](https://github.com/xms12138/casa0014_Zihang_He/tree/main/Zihang_He_Piano)



## Purpose of This Fork

I forked the original repository to host my personal coursework for **CASA0014** and to extend the practical IoT components beyond the base examples. All of my contents are on "[Zihang_He_Piano]" this folder.
 Specifically, this fork includes my individual project:

> **Piano + Metronome MQTT LED Control System**
>  A custom IoT prototype combining musical input, metronome control, and MQTT-based LED visualization.



## Key Additions & Modifications

- Added a new folder **`Zihang_He_Piano/`** containing:
  - Arduino sketches for piano-key and metronome integration.
  - Hardware documentation (`/hardware_components/`) describing sensors, wiring, and device behavior.
- Updated hardware configuration to include:
  - 8 mechanical piano switches.
  - Grove LCD RGB Backlight display for real-time note and BPM readout.
  - Slider potentiometer for BPM adjustment.
  - State-machine switch for toggling between *Performance* and *Metronome* modes.
  - Passive buzzer for rhythmic feedback.



## Why I Only Keep the “vespera” Folder from the Original Repo

- links to [Vespera project folder](vespera)

The **`vespera/`** directory was preserved because it contains:

- Essential **course code** and **reference examples** required for CASA0014 assignments.
- Navigation files that link to the UCL course materials and workshop projects.

All other legacy workshop folders (e.g., *blinking monster*, *plant monitor*) were removed to streamline the repository and focus on current, relevant coursework.
